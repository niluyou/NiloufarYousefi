## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/), and previously advised by [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/). Previously, I was an undergrad at Sharif University of Technology. 

I am interested in advancing the capabilities of transformer-based models, with a focus on addressing problems in sciences. My research explores how neural architectures shape model performance, methods for embedding multimodal data, and strategies for handling
challenges associated with long-context tasks.


I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Professor John W. Simpson-Porco](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~jwsimpson/). Before this, I earned my Master’s degree at Queen’s University (2023) in [ePOWER](https://www.queensu.ca/epower/) group and completed my undergraduate studies at Isfahan University of Technology (2021), majoring in control systems. My expertise lies in the intricate domains of Control Systems, Power Systems, and Power Electronics.

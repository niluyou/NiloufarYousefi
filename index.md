Before this, I earned my Master’s degree at Queen’s University (2023) in the [ePOWER](https://www.queensu.ca/epower/) group and completed my undergraduate studies at Isfahan University of Technology (2021), majoring in control systems. My expertise lies in the intricate domains of Control Systems, Power Systems, and Power Electronics.

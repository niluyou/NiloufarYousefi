I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Professor John W. Simpson-Porco](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~jwsimpson/). Before this, I earned my Master’s degree at Queen’s University (2023) in the [ePOWER](https://www.queensu.ca/epower/) group and completed my undergraduate studies at Isfahan University of Technology (2021), majoring in control systems. My expertise lies in the intersection of Control Systems, Power Systems, and Power Electronics.

## About me
I grew up in Isfahan, Iran, and attended the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talent school. I decided to stay in my hometown for my bachelor's degree and then moved to Canada to continue my graduate studies. I lived in Kingston, Ontario for two years and enjoyed the small, calm city vibe. Later, I moved to Toronto to pursue my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto.

Living in Toronto, I spend weekends cycling along the lakeshore and exploring new spots to eat across the city. For the best blend of city and nature, I recommend riding from Harbourfront to [Tommy Thompson Park](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-network-map/#location=&lat=43.623130&lng=-79.326171&zoom=17)—you’ll get great views of the skyline along the way. Living near major venues, I try to catch as many concerts as I can.
